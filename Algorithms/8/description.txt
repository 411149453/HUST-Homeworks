Description
==================
A network of m roads connects N cities (numbered from 1 to N). There may be more than one road connecting one city with another. Some of the roads are paid. There are two ways to pay for travel on a paid road i from city ai to city bi:

    in advance, in a city ci (which may or may not be the same as ai);
    after the travel, in the city bi.

The payment is Pi in the first case and Ri in the second case.

Write a program to find a minimal-cost route from the city 1 to the city N.

Input
==================
The first line of the input contains the values of N and m. Each of the following m lines describes one road by specifying the values of ai, bi, ci, Pi, Ri (1 ≤ i ≤ m). Adjacent values on the same line are separated by one or more spaces. All values are integers, 1 ≤ m, N ≤ 10, 0 ≤ Pi , Ri ≤ 100, Pi ≤ Ri (1 ≤ i ≤ m).

Output
==================
The first and only line of the file must contain the minimal possible cost of a trip from the city 1 to the city N. If the trip is not possible for any reason, the line must contain the word ‘impossible’.

Sample Input
==================
4 5
1 2 1 10 10
2 3 1 30 50
3 4 3 80 80
2 1 2 10 10
1 3 2 10 50

Sample Output
==================
110
